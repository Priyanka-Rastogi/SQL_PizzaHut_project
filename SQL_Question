or
    SELECT SUM(od.quantity * p.price) AS total_revenue
    FROM order_details od
    JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id;

      
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
    select pizza_types.name,pizza.price
    from pizza_types join pizzas
    on pizza_types.pizza_type_id=pizzas.pizza_type_id
    order by pizzas.price desc limit 1;

4.Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
    SELECT pizzas.size, COUNT(order_details.pizza_id) AS order_count
    FROM order_details
    JOIN pizzas ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
    GROUP BY pizzas.size
    ORDER BY order_count DESC
    LIMIT 1;

    
5.List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
    SELECT pizza_types.name, SUM(order_details.quantity) AS total_quantity
    FROM order_details
    JOIN pizzas ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
    JOIN pizza_types ON pizzas.pizza_type_id = pizza_types.pizza_type_id
    GROUP BY pizza_types.name
    ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
    LIMIT 5;

    

Intermediate:
1. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
    SELECT pizza_types.category, SUM(order_details.quantity) AS total_quantity
    FROM order_details
    JOIN pizzas ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
    JOIN pizza_types ON pizzas.pizza_type_id = pizza_types.pizza_type_id
    GROUP BY pizza_types.category
    ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
    LIMIT 5;

2. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
    Select hour(order_time),count(order_id) from orders
    group by hour(order_time);

3. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
    Select category,count(name) from pizza_types
    group by category;

4. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
    Select avg(quantity) from
    (Select orders.order_date,sum(order_details.quantity) as quantity

    group by orders.order_date) as order_quantity;

5. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
    select pizza_types.name,
    sum(order_details.quantity*pizzas.price) as revenue
    on pizzas.pizza_type_id=pizza_types.pizza_type_id
    join order_details
    on order_details.pizza_id=pizza.pizza_id
    group by pizza_types.name order by revenue desc limit 3;
